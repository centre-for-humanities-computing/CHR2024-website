      <description>I work at the intersection of data science, AI, and the humanities, with an emphasis on questions of gender and race. I am the author of several books, including Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020), coauthored with Catherine D’Ignazio, which was named a “Must-Read Book for Spring 2020” by WIRED Magazine, and An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2020), which shows how thinking about eating can help to tell new stories about the range of people, from the nation’s first presidents to their enslaved chefs, who worked to establish a cultural foundation for the United States.</description>

      <description>We cordially invite you and other interested parties to join the Computational Humanities Research forum! The forum serves as an asynchronous platform to discuss all ideas and questions related to computational humanities research. These can be in-depth discussions about fundamental topics and questions of the discipline, or very practical ones, for example about how best to tackle a certain technical (coding) problem. And everything in between. Come join!</description>

      <description>Submission deadline: July 8, 2024&#xD;In the arts and humanities, the use of computational, statistical, and mathematical approaches has considerably increased in recent years. This research is characterized by the use of formal methods and the construction of explicit, computational models. This includes quantitative, statistical approaches, but also more generally computational methods for processing and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these approaches. Despite the undeniable growth of this research area, many scholars still struggle to find suitable research-oriented venues to present and publish computational work that does not lose sight of traditional modes of inquiry in the arts and humanities.</description>
