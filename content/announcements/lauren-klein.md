        I work at the intersection of data science, AI, and the humanities, with an emphasis on questions of gender and race. I am the author of several books, including Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020), coauthored with Catherine D’Ignazio, which was named a “Must-Read Book for Spring 2020” by WIRED Magazine, and An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2020), which shows how thinking about eating can help to tell new stories about the range of people, from the nation’s first presidents to their enslaved chefs, who worked to establish a cultural foundation for the United States. My next major project, Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization, coauthored with members of my research group, will be published in print and online by the MIT Press in 2024. With Matthew K. Gold, I edit Debates in the Digital Humanities (University of Minnesota Press), a hybrid print/digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge. The most recent book in this series is Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019.
