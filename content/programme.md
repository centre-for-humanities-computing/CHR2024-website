            dm4myth aims to bring together researchers from various disciplines who are interested in studying myths with digital tools and methods.
            We welcome contributions from various disciplines, such as (but not limited to) Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Religious Studies, Classical Studies/Classical Philology, Art History.
            The primary focus of this workshop is to explore the narrative material of mythological stories, underlying belief systems, and the multifaceted representation of characters in mythological contexts using digital methods.
            The full-day workshop is targeted at scholars who work on interdisciplinary research questions, which involve mythological (and derivative) topics and the application or development of computer science methods and algorithms.
            We welcome participants from all stages of their academic career, from (under-)graduate students to early career researchers and senior researchers. (<a href="https://dm4myth.github.io">https://dm4myth.github.io</a>)

           Data will be provided and each part of the workshop will cover different stages of the research workflow, addressing theoretical, methodological, and interpretative challenges.
